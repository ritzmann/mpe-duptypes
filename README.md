Overview
========
duptypes.groovy is a script that operates on data generated by [MyPhoneExplorer](http://www.fjsoft.at/en/).

MyPhoneExplorer is a comprehensive and free sync solution for Android, Windows, Outlook and much more.

The Outlook address book suffers from a limitation in that it can only store one phone number of each type per contact. If you have a contact with e.g. two cell phone numbers stored in your Android contacts, after syncing with MyPhoneExplorer the contact in Outlook will only have one cell phone number.

duptypes.groovy searches all contacts managed by MyPhoneExplorer and lists the contacts that have multiple entries of the same type. That allows you to edit these contacts and assign their phone numbers to different types. You could e.g. change one of the cell phone numbers of your contact to be the business phone number.

How to use
==========
* Sync your phone with MyPhoneExplorer.
* From the contacts view in MyPhonExplorer, press the right mouse button and choose to export all contacts.
* Store the exported contacts in vCard format.
* Run the script with
        groovy duptypes.groovy D:\path\to\file.vcard

The script will print the names of all contacts that have multiple entries of the same type. You can then edit these contacts in MyPhoneExplorer and sync again.
